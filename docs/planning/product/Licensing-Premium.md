# JJ Flex — Licensing & Premium Features (Planning)

Last updated: 2026-01-31
Status: Exploratory

## Goal
Keep JJ Flex open source while enabling optional revenue to offset costs (time, hosting, AI tools, etc.)
without harming accessibility or locking out core functionality.

## Guiding Approach
- Core accessibility and basic radio control remain free/open.
- Premium features should be “nice-to-have,” advanced, or resource-intensive.

## Possible Premium Candidates
- Multi-radio simultaneous operation (Flex + SDR source at same time)
- Advanced SDR demod/decoding pipelines and specialty features
- Enhanced contest tooling packs (voice keyer presets, automation)
- Advanced audio routing/mixing beyond baseline
- Cloud/shared profiles or remote orchestration features (if ever built)

## Open Source Friendly Options
1. **Dual distribution**: OSS core + paid “pro” add-on modules
2. **Feature flags**: build-time or runtime modules with license checks (keep core OSS)
3. **Sponsorship-first**: GitHub Sponsors + optional paid convenience features

## Notes
- Avoid putting basic accessibility behind a paywall.
- Be transparent: what’s premium and why.
- Keep community trust by maintaining a strong OSS baseline.
